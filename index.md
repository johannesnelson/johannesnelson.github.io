My name is Johannes. I am a data scientist and ecologist, passionate about finding 
innovative ways to protect and gain insight into the natural world. 

My programming skillset allows me to contribute to projects in a variety of ways, 
from scripting complex data analysis pipelines to developing LLM-powered classifiers 
to streamline essential processes. 

I also specialize in bioacoustic monitoring--the use of recording equipment and
artificial intelligence for conducting ecological assessments and wildlife surveys 
at scale. Because of my love for birds/wildlife, I feel particularly drawn to
work that seeks to mitigate our global biodiversity crisis.

I made this website to showcase my [projects](/projects/) and skills. It also houses 
my [resume](resume.md) and a [blog](/blog/), where I write about things I've 
worked on. I love learning how to do new things. Let's work together!
