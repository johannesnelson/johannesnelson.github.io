My name is Johannes. I like birds, computers, and finding innovative ways to
protect and gain insight into the natural world. 

I specialize in bioacoustic monitoring--the use of recording equipment and
artificial intelligence for conducting ecological assessments and wildlife surveys 
at scale. My wider programming skillset allows me to contribute to projects in 
a variety of ways, from scripting complex data analysis pipelines to creating LLM-powered 
classifiers to streamline essential processes. I love learning how to do new things.

I made this website to showcase my projects and skills. It also houses my [resume](https://johannesnelson.github.io/resume/){:.heading.flip-title} and 
a [blog](https://johannesnelson.github.io/blog/){:.heading.flip-title}.

 in programming allows
me to support and write code for :
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
