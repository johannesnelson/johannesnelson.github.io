My name is Johannes. I like birds, computers, and finding innovative ways to
protect and gain insight into the natural world. 

I specialize in bioacoustic monitoring--the use of recording equipment and
artificial intelligence for conducting ecological assessments and wildlife surveys 
at scale. My wider programming skillset allows me to contribute to projects in 
a variety of ways, from scripting complex data analysis pipelines to creating LLM-powered 
classifiers to streamline essential processes. I love learning how to do new things.

I made this website to showcase my projects and skills. It also houses my [resume](resume.md) and a [blog](/blog/), where I write about things I've 
worked on.
