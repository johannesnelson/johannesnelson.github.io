  Deep learning models are at the heart of major shifts across many sectors. These models
  have millions (or billions) of learnable parameters that sit in various layers and configurations
  depending on the task at hand. Most of my deep learning work focuses on using convolutional neural 
  networks to classify audio/image data, but I have also integrated large language models into 
  various workflows/projects.
