  summary: >
    I am a data scientist specializing in bioacoustics and conservation analytics. 
    My research has primarily focused on the use of passive acoustic monitoring to 
    survey wildlife communities and monitor biodiversity metrics—combining traditional 
    field work techniques with deep learning/artificial intelligence for data processing 
    and analysis. My programming skills in R and Python allow me to contribute to 
    projects in a variety of ways, from building complex data analysis pipelines to 
    automating/streamlining essential processes. I also have extensive experience as an 
    educator in progressive, inquiry-based classrooms around the world. I hope to continue 
    working at the intersection of technology and ecology--using innovative deep learning 
    solutions to promote conservation and discovery.

    summary: >
      During this short-term data science consultancy, I was responsible 
      for developing scripts in R to create a full data analysis pipeline
      to extract, clean/preprocess, and analyze data from tree monitoring
      surveys around the world. This monitoring program provides 
      essential metrics about Mastercard’s Priceless Planet Coalition,
      which aims to restore 100 million trees through a number of 
      major restoration projects in key areas around the globe. 

      Along with scripts to extract and wrangle/clean the monitoring 
      data from Kobotoolbox, I wrote scripts that used a combination 
      of techniques like web-scraping and API calls to various databases
      to create reports of potentially invasive species being planted;
      scripts that cleaned/corrected scientific names to accepted names 
      while also adding other taxonomic information like family; and 
      scripts that streamlined the process of labelling species as 
      native or introduced with interactive functionality that shows 
      color-coded occurrence data along with relevant sentences 
      scraped from Wikipedia pages to assist the user in making a designation.

      To further enable the native/introduced classification process, I used 
      LangChain in Python to create an LLM powered classifier that bases its 
      classification decision for each species-country pairing entirely on 
      relevant Wikipedia text. With clear, effective prompt engineering that 
      breaks the reasoning process into multiple steps, this AI tool outputs 
      a classification decision, the cited text, and descriptions of the 
      intermediate reasoning steps that led to the decision.
