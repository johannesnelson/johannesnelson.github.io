  summary: >
    I am a data scientist specializing in bioacoustics and conservation analytics. 
    My research has primarily focused on the use of passive acoustic monitoring to 
    survey wildlife communities and monitor biodiversity metrics—combining traditional 
    field work techniques with deep learning/artificial intelligence for data processing 
    and analysis. My programming skills in R and Python allow me to contribute to 
    projects in a variety of ways, from building complex data analysis pipelines to 
    automating/streamlining essential processes. I also have extensive experience as an 
    educator in progressive, inquiry-based classrooms around the world. I hope to continue 
    working at the intersection of technology and ecology--using innovative deep learning 
    solutions to promote conservation and discovery.

      During this short-term data science consultancy, I was responsible 
      for developing scripts in R to create a full data analysis pipeline
      to extract, clean/preprocess, and analyze data from tree monitoring
      surveys around the world. This monitoring program provides 
      essential metrics about Mastercard’s Priceless Planet Coalition,
      which aims to restore 100 million trees through a number of 
      major restoration projects in key areas around the globe.
    highlights:
      - Built complex, multi-script pipeline to extract monitoring data from Kobo Toolbox, 
        preprocess/wrangle it, correct taxonomic information using various online databases 
        and API calls, and finally to calculate key indicator metrics that will be used to 
        evaluate the success of all restoration projects in the portfolio.
      - Developed script that uses a combination of API calls and web-scraping to screen
        multiple thousands of species across dozens of organizations for potentially invasive
        status.
      - Created a streamlined, semi-automated process for further classification of planting data
        into categories of native or alien using spatial occurence data from public databases and
        relevant text called and filtered from Wikipedia.
      - Built a Large Language Model powered classification agent using LangChain in Python to 
        automate the process of native-alien classifcation using intentional prompt engineering to 
        produce an organized report

      During this summer position, I primarily supported efforts for a research project about the 
      Eastern Towhee but also participated in other organization activities like MAPS banding. 
    highlights:
      - I assisted the lead researcher in nest-searching, active mist-netting, trapping,
        banding, and MOTUS tagging of Eastern Towhees.
      - Attended the American Ornithological society conference in Puerto Rico.

      This school's curricular program is built of the Common Core. I developed, largely from scratch, the programming/
      curriculum for the 5th grade History/Social studies classes as the school underwent accreditation.
    highlights:
      - Designed units of study focused on the social and environmental impacts of a linear, materials economy; bias and
        power in historical narratives; and how resource management choices impact social and environmental welfare.

      Here I was a 5th grade, IB Primary Years Program (PYP) teacher. My prior IB teaching experience allowed me to guide
      the team and the school in their transition to the PYP program--an interdisciplinary, inquiry-based approach to teaching.
    highlights:
      - Taught students from 15+ nationalities and fostered a culture of empathy, collaboration, and open-mindedness
      - Helped spearhead the school's first 5th grade PYP exhibition
      - Planned field experiences for students to make connections to local communities and ecosystems while learning about 
        key resource management issues in the region such as overfishing, desertification, and food scarcity
