  summary: >
    I am a data scientist specializing in bioacoustics and conservation analytics. 
    My research has primarily focused on the use of passive acoustic monitoring to 
    survey wildlife communities and monitor biodiversity metrics—combining traditional 
    field work techniques with deep learning/artificial intelligence for data processing 
    and analysis. My programming skills in R and Python allow me to contribute to 
    projects in a variety of ways, from building complex data analysis pipelines to 
    automating/streamlining essential processes. I also have extensive experience as an 
    educator in progressive, inquiry-based classrooms around the world. I hope to continue 
    working at the intersection of technology and ecology--using innovative deep learning 
    solutions to promote conservation and discovery.
